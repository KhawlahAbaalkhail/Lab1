Dataset & Analysis Summary

The dataset consists of credit card transaction records, where each row represents a single transaction and each column represents a specific feature such as transaction time, transaction amount, anonymized numerical variables, and a target variable indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent or legitimate. The dataset contains primarily numerical features and required basic inspection and duplicate handling before analysis.

The analytical process focused on exploratory data analysis (EDA), where the data was examined, cleaned, and visualized to identify patterns and relationships. The analysis included studying the distribution of transaction amounts and time, examining the imbalance between fraud and non-fraud cases, analyzing differences in transaction behavior across classes, and exploring correlations between features.

This analysis helps in understanding transaction behavior, class imbalance, and key characteristics associated with fraudulent activity, providing meaningful insights from financial transaction data before applying any predictive modeling techniques.
