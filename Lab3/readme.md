Dataset & Analysis Summary

The dataset consists of chocolate sales records, where each row represents a single sales transaction and each column represents a specific feature such as date, country, product, sales person, number of boxes shipped, and revenue amount. The dataset includes both numerical and categorical variables and required basic data cleaning before analysis.

The analytical process focused on exploratory data analysis (EDA), where the data was inspected, cleaned, and visualized to identify patterns and relationships. The task involved analyzing distributions of key variables, examining relationships between boxes shipped and revenue, comparing sales performance across countries and products, and exploring revenue trends over time.

This analysis helps in understanding sales behavior, revenue distribution, and performance variations across different factors, providing meaningful insights from structured business data.
