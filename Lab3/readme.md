Dataset & Analysis Summary

The dataset consists of news articles, where each row represents a single article and each column represents a specific feature such as the article text, title (if available), and a label indicating whether the news is fake or real. The dataset primarily contains textual data along with a categorical target variable used to distinguish between classes.

The analytical process focused on exploratory data analysis (EDA), where the dataset was inspected, cleaned, and examined to understand its structure and characteristics. The analysis included evaluating the distribution of fake and real news articles, measuring article length through character and word counts, and comparing textual patterns across classes.

This analysis helps in understanding structural differences between fake and real news content, identifying class balance, and extracting meaningful insights from textual data before applying any predictive modeling techniques.
